# PicTacToe

Android Tic Tac Toe App appropriately named Pic Tac Toe because instead of the traditional 'X' and 'O', the app uses pictures to identify 
the players.

The game has 3 game mode options that can be selected, which are Single Player: Easy, Single Player: Hard, and Multi Player. User(s) of the
app are required to take a picture (of anything) in order to get to the game screen and play the game.

The app utiflizes the Minimax Algorithm for the Single Player modes to have the computer to make a move. 

App preserves the game data during configuration changes and supports portrait or landscape mode.



# About Me
I am a self-taught programmer and have taken a strong liking to Android app development. This is the first project that I have
completed since I started my programming journey. I am still learning more about Computer Science every day and I welcome any constructive
criticism, comments, insights, or anything else that may help me become a better programmer. As I prepare to start applying for jobs in 
a couple of months, there will be more projects coming to my GitHub account whenever I finish them, for those that are interested.
